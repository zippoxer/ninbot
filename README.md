# ninbot
ninbot is a bot for the browser game theninja-rpg.com.
ninbot logins to your character, fights and trains to level up.
Character profiles are kept in conf.

## Does it still work?
I wrote ninbot in 2011, before Go 1 was introduced. It won't build with Go 1.X.

## So what can I do with it?
Explore the code or fix it if you will ;)
